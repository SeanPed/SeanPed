### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ I am Patrick, a fresh web developer after learning in a bootcamp at neuefische GmbH. 
I live in Hamburg, Germany and I am looking forward for some like minded people and more opportunities to learn.âœ¨
#
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Redux, MySQL and more Node.js
- ðŸ‘¾ Iâ€™m trying to learn some basic game design and programming for hobby projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about all you want.
